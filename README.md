CipherMenace: Secure Computer Lockdown Interface

![GUI Screenshot]() 


📜 Project Overview
CipherMenace is a security application that locks down your computer interface, simulating a secure environment for testing and demonstration purposes. With its interactive GUI, CipherMenace provides a visually engaging method to simulate real-world scenarios involving system lockdowns and password protection mechanisms.

✨ Features
Full-Screen Lockdown: Completely locks the user's computer until the correct password is provided.
Customizable Password: The default password is predefined, but you can modify it for your testing needs.
Limited Attempts: Users have a set number of tries (default: 5) to unlock the interface before a simulated BSOD (Blue Screen of Death).
Interactive Keypad: Includes a graphical keypad for password entry.
Custom Lock Message: Displays a bold and customizable lock message.
